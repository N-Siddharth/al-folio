I am a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University, advised by [Dr. Fabio Semperlotti](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/People/ptProfile?resource_id=126925) and part of [Ray W. Herrick Laboratories](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Herrick).

My work focuses on the development of [computational mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_mechanics) models using [scientific machine learning](https://oden.utexas.edu/research/crosscutting-research-areas/scientific-machine-learning/#:~:text=What%20is%20Scientific%20Machine%20Learning,applications%20across%20science%20and%20engineering.) for mechanical and aeronautical engineering applications. Specifically, my research experience is in the fields of material design and modeling, wave propagation, acoustics, nonlocal mechanics, structural dynamics, physics-guided scientific machine learning, and deep neural networks.
